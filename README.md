## üõ† Setting Up a Python Virtual Environment

Choose one of the following methods based on your preference:

### üì¶ Using Pipenv
```

 ```

```


pip install pipenv

```

2. Install project dependencies:
```

pipenv install

```

3. Activate the environment:
```

pipenv shell

```

---

### üêç Using pip and venv

1. Create a virtual environment:
```

python -m venv venv

````

2. Activate the environment:

- macOS/Linux:
  ```
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- Windows:
  ```
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

3. Install dependencies:
````

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

---

### üçÉ Using Conda

1. Create an environment:
```

conda create --name myenv python=3.11

```

2. Activate the environment:
```

conda activate myenv

```

3. Install dependencies:
```

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## üèÉ Running the Application

The project is divided into three phases. Run them individually in separate terminals:

### üìå Phase 1: Create AI Agent
```

python ai\_agent.py

```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Phase 2: Setup Backend with FastAPI
```

python backend.py

```

### üíª Phase 3: Setup Frontend with Streamlit
```

python frontend.py

```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

‚úÖ **Ensure the backend (`backend.py`) is running in a separate terminal** before launching the frontend.
